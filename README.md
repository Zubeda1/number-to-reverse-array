# number-to-reverse-array
kata description : Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.
Example: (Input => Output):
35231 => [1,3,2,5,3]
0 => [0]
there will be a number of ways to solve this but i enourage people to try using javascripts built in array methods. You can array methods as long as the output of the method is another array.

TESTING -
to run tests use: npm test / npm test:watch (test:watch will rerun the tests whenever you make a change and will save you having to rerun npm test constantly)
make up your own tests for your solution, you can use the basic tests in convert-num-to-reverse-array.test.js as a guideline.
